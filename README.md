# Kids Learning Project

This project was part of the Human Computer Interaction Class at FGCU.
The goal was to build a simple User Interface and study how young users interact with the Android Application. Such study includes counting the number of clicks per button, and 
the time spent on the application.
This Application is meant for children to learn colors, numbers, and days.
